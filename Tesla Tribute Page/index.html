        <h3>Early Life</h3>
        <p>
          Nikola Tesla was born in Smiljan, in what is now Croatia, to Milutin
          Tesla, an Eastern Orthodox priest, and Georgina ƒêuka Tesla. From a
          young age, Tesla showed a prodigious interest in mathematics and
          mechanics, often astounding his family and friends with his inventive
          ideas and problem-solving skills.

        <h3>Career and Achievements</h3>
        <p>
          Tesla's career in electrical engineering began in Europe, where he
          worked for the Continental Edison Company. In 1884, he emigrated to
          the United States and worked briefly for Thomas Edison before
          branching out on his own. Tesla's inventions and discoveries include
          the development of the alternating current (AC) electrical system, the
          Tesla coil, and numerous other contributions that have become the
          backbone of modern electricity and wireless communication.
